# Image Activity Monitor

This sample application demonstrates a simple Windows Forms client structured using Domain Driven Design. The solution is divided into three main layers:

- **Domain** – contains the core entities and domain interfaces.
- **Application** – hosts services that orchestrate domain logic.
- **Infrastructure** – provides implementations for UI and data access.
- **UI** – the Windows Forms front end.

Run `dotnet build` to compile the project. (A compatible .NET SDK is required.)
